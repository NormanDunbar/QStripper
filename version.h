// Version History
//
// 1.01 - Added a new version numbering system.
//
//        Allowed PC Quill files to be opened.
//
// 1.02 - Corrected a bug whereby every file was being translated from
//        PC Quill format to QL Quill. This was a bad thing!
//
//        Moved the version number to its own header file.
//
// 1.03 - Extended the DOS to QL conversion table with details kindly
//        supplied by Geoff Wicks as a jpeg image. (Which has been
//        added to the Subversion repository.)
