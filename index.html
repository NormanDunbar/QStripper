	<h3><img style="width: 27px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/quill.png">Browser Problems?</h3>

<p><strong>If the contents links at the left of the screen scroll up and
down, plus you see a large gap between the heading above and this paragraph,
then you are using a severely broken browser - probably Internet Explorer 5.5
or similar. To enhance your browsing experience, get a proper CSS compliant
browser such as Opera or Firefox - they are free.</strong></p>

<p>Get <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox here</a>. <br>
Get <a href="http://opera.com">Opera here</a>.</p>

<p>Die hard users of Internet Explorer may wish to try out IE8 or IE9 but you will probably  
still be disapointed. CSS standards and Microsoft don't work well together!</p>

<a name="introduction"</a>
<h3><img style="width: 27px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/quill.png">Introduction</h3>

<p>This is yet another version of my old favourite Stripper program. This one
is written using the Open Source version of <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Nokia</a>'s 
QT4 toolkit for C++ developers.</p>

<p>This version allows output to plain text, pdf, DocBook XML and HTML. You can
(hopefully) soon run the same code on Windows and/or Linux. Version 1.06 added support for
Open Office and Libre Office by allowing exports in ODF format.</p>

<a name="downloads"</a>
<h3><img style="width: 27px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/quill.png">Downloads</h3>
<p>The downloads for this application are in two parts. The first is the
support files - dlls on Windows - that are required by the
compiler system, the QT4 system and whatever else I can squeeze in as well!</p>

<p>The second is the application itself. Because the application is not statically
linked (to the libraries etc), you only need the support files once - unless a
new release of QT or the compiler I use comes out which requires an upgrade.</p>

<p>Only Windows users require the support files. Linux users, especially those 
with KDE as their desktop, most likely already have the support files installed. 
If not, install them using your package manager.</p>

<p>The main downloads page for <em>all</em> versions of QStripper is:<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qstripper/files/">here</a>.</p>

<a name="sourcecode"</a>
<h3><img style="width: 27px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/quill.png">Sourcecode Downloads</h3>
<p>The source code can be checked out from the Subversion repository using the command <pre>svn co https://qstripper.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qstripper qstripper </pre></p>
<p>The source can also be obtained from the daily snapshot as a <em>tarball</em> from <a href="http://qstripper.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qstripper/?view=tar">here</a>.</p>
	
<a name="installation"</a>
<h3><img style="width: 27px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/quill.png">Installation</h3>
<p>Installation is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder.</li>
<li>Download the two zip files to that folder.</li>
<li>Unzip the two zip files into the new folder.</li>
<li>Double-click on QStripper.exe.</li>
</ul>


<a name="windows"</a>
<h3><img style="width: 27px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/quill.png">Windows</h3>

<p>The program is not statically linked so you must first download the support
files for your version of Windows, then install the application and when you 
have done this, it is all ready to go.</p>

<p>There are versions available for 32 and 64 bit Windows.</p>

<p>Remember - whenever I make subsequent updates to the program, you will only
have to download the updated application - that saves a lot of time!</p>


<a name="linux">
	<h3><img style="width: 27px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/quill.png">Linux</h3>

<p>The program is not statically linked so you must first install the support
files via your package manager, then install the application and when you have 
done this, it is all ready to go.</p>

<p>At present, only 64 bit Linux is supported as that's unfortunately all I have on my development laptop.<p>
<p>If you only have a 32 bit Linux install, please download and compile the <a href="#sourcecode">source code</a>. Until further notice.</p>

<a name="macos">
	<h3><img style="width: 27px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/quill.png">MAC-OS</h3>
	<p>As I have no access to any Apple kit of any kind, I'm unable to supply a compiled version of QStripper
	for your particular brand of computer. However, the Qt toolkit and tools are all cross-platform, so Mac 
	users may download the <a href="#sourcecode">source code</a> and compile it locally.</p>

<a name="features">
	<h3><img style="width: 27px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/quill.png">Features</h3>
<p>The features of the application are :</p>
<ul>
<li>It's free.</li>
<li>Source code is available from the Subversion repository using the 
command <pre>svn co https://qstripper.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qstripper qstripper </pre>  or, alternatively, 
as a <em>tarball</em> from  <a href="http://qstripper.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qstripper/?view=tar">here</a>.</li>
<li>Multi-platform. 32 and 64 bit Windows, 64 bit Linux. 32 bit Linux and Mac users need to get the source and compile it at present I'm afraid.</li>
<li>Drag and Drop files from Explorer, Dolphin, Konquerer etc.</li>
<li>Pass filenames on the command line.</li>
<li>Can convert both QL and PC versions of Quill documents.</li>
<li>Produces plain text output.</li>
<li>Prints Quill docs.</li>
<li>Can output PDF files.</li>
<li>HTML conversions of Quill documents.</li>
<li>Did I mention that it was free?</li>
<li>Output to DocBook XML for further formatting.</li>
<li>From version 1.06, output to Open Document Format (odf) for Libre/Open Office.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<a name="pdf">
	<h3><img style="width: 27px; height: 48px;" alt="" src="images/quill.png">Going Further With PDF</h3>
<p>The pdf output from the program is quite good and acceptable. However, if
you output in DocBook XML format and run a special utility, you can produce
even better looking and usually smaller (by about 10-15%) files. This utility
is named <strong>XMLMind FO Converter</strong>, it is free and is <a href="http:
//www.xmlmind.com/foconverter/"> available here</a>. You should select the
Personal Edition.</p>

<p><strong>XMLMind FO Converter</strong> produces the following output from a
DocBook XML input file :</p>

<ul>
<li>Rich Text Format</li>
<li>Word ML - whatever that is!</li>
<li>HTML - paged with navigation bar etc.</li>
<li>HTML - all on one single page.</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>EPUB - for eReaders, but not Amazon's Kindle.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the above web site, they advise that the utility is suitable for smaller
personal projects and is quite simple in its features. Should you wish to <i>go
the whole hog</i>, then you should wander over to the <a href="http://www.
renderx.com/">RenderX</a> web site and download a personal copy of <strong>XEP
</strong> which (apparently) does a far better job. (Just don't install it in a
folder that has spaces in the name!)</p>

<p><strong>XMLMind FO Converter</strong> has a GUI interface which makes life
easier when selecting files, formats and so on. <strong>XEP</strong> is a
commandline utility only, unless you buy the full version.</p>

<p>However, having said that, get both and you can use the later versions of XMLMind's
utility to call out to the XEP utility instead of it's own one to do the final rendering 
into pdf.

<p><strong>Both</strong> of the above require a version of Java to be installed
on the machine you are using and both run quite happily under Windows or Linux.
