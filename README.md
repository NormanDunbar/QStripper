# QStripper

*QStripper* will convert Sinclair QL word processing (Quill etc) documents to pdf, html, text, DocBook XML, Libre Office ODF, 
ReStructuredText and ASCIIDoctor formats. The source document can have been created on either the Sinclair QL using the *Psion Suite* (specifically Quill), 
or *Xchange*, or, created on a PC using the *Psion 4* suite of programs from the 1980's.
