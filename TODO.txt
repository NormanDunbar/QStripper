QStripper TODO list :
---------------------

B) Fix 'out of sequence' errors properly.
E) Add better context menu to text edit area. Cut paste etc.
E) Better HTML output.
B) Got a funny when the first paragraph in the document is <U><B>Stuff</B></U> as the <HR> is drawn below the first paramrgaph and not under the header (which is blank in this case). Weird.
B) FIXED. When using Explorer, select many files and OPEN WITH, only one opens. (Per) 
B) When a file is modified, exporting (at least as XML) doesn't clear the modification status.
B) SORT OF FIXED. WORKS IN LINUX! Fix that bloody (XML) Euro ! QUILL=$80=128, WIN=$B5=181,
ISO-8859-15=$A4 It's not displaying nor is it exporting correctly. It seems to export as
$80 again. XMLSpy rejects it.
B) LINUX ONLY - when focus in the edit window. The text drop down is not updating with
the text family name. Works fine in WINDOWS.

For Per.
--------

E) Option to display, print and export document in origininal width (cpl).
E) Dont include hidden footers.
E) Centring of centred text (floating centre in variable width mode).
E) Closer tab emulation.
E) Selectable display and print fonts; at least allow fixed font.
E) Option to let program minimise when last document closed
E) FIXED. My only problem is that when the program first displays a document, only a tiny corner is displayed in a small window. Why not fill the page? Or is there a way I havent yet discovered?
