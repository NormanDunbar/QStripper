<a href="introduction"</a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This is yet another version of my old favourite Stripper program. This one
is written using the new Open Source version of <a href="http://www.trolltech.
com">Trolltech</a>'s QT4 toolkit for C++ developers.</p>

<p>This version allows output to plain text, pdf, DocBook XML and HTML. You can
(hopefully) soon run the same code on Windows and/or Linux.</p>

<a name="downloads"</a>
<h3>Downloads</h3>
<p>The downloads for this application are in two parts. The first is the
support files, dlls on Windows and libs on Linux, that are required by the
compiler system, the QT4 system and whatever else I can squeeze in as well!
The second is the application itself. Because the application is not statically
linked (to the libraries etc), you only need the support files once - unless a
new release of QT or the compiler I use comes out which requires an upgrade.</p>

<a name="installation"</a>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Installation is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder.</li>
<li>Download the two zip files to that folder.</li>
<li>Unzip the two zip files into the new folder.</li>
<li>Double-click on QStripper.exe.</li>
</ul>


<a name="windows"</a>
<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>The program is not statically linked so you must first download the support
files, then the application and when you have done this, it is all ready to go.</p>

<ul>
<li>Download <a href="downloads/win_support.zip">Windows Support Files.</a> (About 3 Mb)</li>
<li>Download <a href="downloads/win_qstripper.zip">Qstripper for Windows.</a> (About 70 Kb)</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember - whenever I make subsequent updates to the program, you will only
have to download the updated application - that saves a lot of time!</p>


<a name="linux">
<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm developing on Windows first and then moving that to Linux.
At present, I do not have anything for you to download. Watch this space .....</p>

<p>The program is not statically linked so you must first download the support
files, then the application and when you have done this, it is all ready to go.</p>

<ul>
<li>Download <a href="downloads/lin_support.zip">Linux Support Files.</a> (About ???? Mb)</li>
<li>Download <a href="downloads/lin_qstripper.zip">QStripper for Linux.</a> (About ???? Kb)</li>
</ul>

<a name="features">
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The fetures of the application are :</p>
<ul>
<li>It's free.</li>
<li>Source code is/will be available.</li>
<li>Multi-platform.</li>
<li>Drag and Drop files from Explorer or Konquerer.</li>
<li>Pass filenames on the command line.</li>
<li>Produces plain text output.</li>
<li>Prints Quill docs.</li>
<li>Can output PDF files.</li>
<li>HTML conversions of Quill documents.</li>
<li>Did I mention that it was free?</li>
<li>Output to DocBook XML for further formatting.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>The pdf output from the program is quite good and acceptable. However, if
you output in DocBook XML format and run a special utility, you can produce
even better looking and usually smaller (by about 10-15%) files. This utility
is named XMLMind FO Converter, it is free and is <a href="http://www.xmlmind.
com/foconverter/"> available here</a>. You should select the Personal Edition.</p>
