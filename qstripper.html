<h3>Browser Problems?</h3>

<p><strong>If the contents links at the left of the screen scroll up and
down, plus you see a large gap between the heading above and this paragraph,
then you are using a severely broken browser - probably Internet Explorer 5.5
or similar. To enhance your browsing experience, get a proper CSS compliant
browser such as Opera or Firefox - they are free.</strong></p>

<p>Get <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox here</a>. <br>
Get <a href="http://opera.com">Opera here</a>.</p>

<p>Die hard users of Internet Explorer may wish to try out IE7 or IE8 but you will 
still be disapointed as it still isn't CSS standards compliant and still doesn't work.</p>

<a name="introduction"</a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This is yet another version of my old favourite Stripper program. This one
is written using the new Open Source version of <a href="http://www.trolltech.
com">Trolltech</a>'s QT4 toolkit for C++ developers.</p>

<p>This version allows output to plain text, pdf, DocBook XML and HTML. You can
(hopefully) soon run the same code on Windows and/or Linux.</p>

<a name="downloads"</a>
<h3>About The Downloads</h3>
<p>The downloads for this application are in two parts. The first is the
support files, dlls on Windows and libs on Linux, that are required by the
compiler system, the QT4 system and whatever else I can squeeze in as well!
The second is the application itself. Because the application is not statically
linked (to the libraries etc), you only need the support files once - unless a
new release of QT or the compiler I use comes out which requires an upgrade.</p>

<a name="installation"</a>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Installation is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder.</li>
<li>Download the two zip files to that folder.</li>
<li>Unzip the two zip files into the new folder.</li>
<li>Double-click on QStripper.exe.</li>
</ul>


<a name="windows"</a>
<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>The program is not statically linked so you must first download the support
files, then the application and when you have done this, it is all ready to go.</p>

<ul>
<li>Download <a href="downloads/win_support.zip">Windows Support Files.</a> (About 3 Mb)</li>
<li>Download <a href="downloads/win_qstripper.zip">Qstripper for Windows.</a> (About 70 Kb)</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember - whenever I make subsequent updates to the program, you will only
have to download the updated application - that saves a lot of time!</p>


<a name="linux">
<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm developing on Windows first and then moving that to Linux.
At present, I do not have anything for you to download. Watch this space .....</p>

<p>The program is not statically linked so you must first download the support
files, then the application and when you have done this, it is all ready to go.</p>

<ul>
<li>Download <a href="downloads/lin_support.zip">Linux Support Files.</a> (About ???? Mb)</li>
<li>Download <a href="downloads/lin_qstripper.zip">QStripper for Linux.</a> (About ???? Kb)</li>
</ul>

<a name="features">
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The features of the application are :</p>
<ul>
<li>It's free.</li>
<li>Source code is/will be available.</li>
<li>Multi-platform.</li>
<li>Drag and Drop files from Explorer or Konquerer.</li>
<li>Pass filenames on the command line.</li>
<li>Produces plain text output.</li>
<li>Prints Quill docs.</li>
<li>Can output PDF files.</li>
<li>HTML conversions of Quill documents.</li>
<li>Did I mention that it was free?</li>
<li>Output to DocBook XML for further formatting.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<a name="pdf">
<h3>Going Further With PDF</h3>
<p>The pdf output from the program is quite good and acceptable. However, if
you output in DocBook XML format and run a special utility, you can produce
even better looking and usually smaller (by about 10-15%) files. This utility
is named <strong>XMLMind FO Converter</strong>, it is free and is <a href="http:
//www.xmlmind.com/foconverter/"> available here</a>. You should select the
Personal Edition.</p>

<p><strong>XMLMind FO Converter</strong> produces the following output from a
DocBook XML input file :</p>

<ul>
<li>Rich Text Format</li>
<li>Word ML - whatever that is!</li>
<li>HTML - paged with navigation bar etc.</li>
<li>HTML - all on one single page.</li>
<li>PDF</li>
</ul>

<p>On the above web site, they advise that the utility is suitable for smaller
personal projects and is quite simple in its features. Should you wish to <i>go
the whole hog</i>, then you should wander over to the <a href="http://www.
renderx.com/">RenderX</a> web site and download a personal copy of <strong>XEP
</strong> which (apparently) does a far better job. (Just don't install it in a
folder that has spaces in the name!)</p>

<p><strong>XMLMind FO Converter</strong> has a GUI interface which makes life
easier when selecting files, formats and so on. <strong>XEP</strong> is a
commandline utility only, unless you buy the full version.</p>

<p>However, having said that, get both and you can use the later versions of XMLMind's
utility to call out to the XEP utility instead of it's own one to do the final rendering 
into pdf.

<p><strong>Both</strong> of the above require a version of Java to be installed
on the machine you are using and both run quite happily under Windows or Linux.
